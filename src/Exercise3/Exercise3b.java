         * Create a Bank Management System which has the following components:
         * Person (which saves first, middle and last name, age and a "social security number")
         * Bank (which saves a List of customers and their Checking Accounts, maximum overdraw amount)
         * Checking Account (should have a current value, methods for taking and depositing money)
         * Opening a Checking Account should only work via a Bank and must require a certain amount of initial deposit.
